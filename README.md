## AEGIS

Aegis is a platformer game done by two students for a UPC-TTC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - TECH TALENT CENTER) project in Barcelona, Catalunya.

The game is about the path of the fire wisp, witch has to collect the green gems from the magic caves and will face several dangerous monsters. In this adventure, his most valuable skill will be the velocity, witch will make him survive as he is defenseless.

This game it's been done  using "Tile" program and it has two levels. It is fully programmed in C++ using SDL library;

## Game Main Core
The structure has been made using a module called application witch calls the main functions of all the application modules to make them work such as Start(), Update() - pre and pos, Clear() ... App is the module that controls when do other modules work.
All data such ass animation pushbacks or internal data of the application was set up using XML files to avoid harcoded values for variables.


All regarding to game metadata (paths of assets, character and enemies characteristics...) are loaded with XML files to avoid hardcoding,
avoid confusing code and build an easier work flow.

### Innovations
*flipping of textures.
*Enemies that detect obstacles and avoids them jumping over them
*Render system witch avoids calling tiles that are not inside camera even if it is was not going to  print them, this was made to avoid checking useless info and save time.
*System witch makes the player rotate making a perfect parabola when jumping.
*load all colliders and entities from the XML generated by tiled.
*system to avoid tunelling witch has been made using sensors that detect how much space you have to make a dash
